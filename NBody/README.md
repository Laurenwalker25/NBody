**Background:** This project is for CS201 at Duke University. This assignment heavily borrows from Princeton and Berkeley Computer Science and the work of Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne and Josh Hug.

**Context:** In 1687, Isaac Newton formulated the principles governing the motion of two particles under the influence of their mutual gravitational attraction in his famous Principia. However, Newton was unable to solve the problem for three particles. Indeed, in general, solutions to systems of three or more particles must be approximated via numerical simulations. In this project, I write a program to simulate the motion of _N_ objects in a plane, mutually affected by gravitational forces, and animate the results. Such methods are widely used in cosmology, semiconductors, and fluid dynamics to study complex physical systems. Ultimately, I create a driver program `NBody.java` that draws an animation of bodies moving in space interacting with each other subject to interacting and mutual gravitational forces. These bodies are modeled by the class `CelestialBody.java` that I implement and test independently of the simulation.
